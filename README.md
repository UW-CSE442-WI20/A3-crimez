### Install

#### Required software

You must have Node.js installed. I prefer to install it using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
because it doesn't require sudo and makes upgrades easier, but you can also just get it directly from
https://nodejs.org/en/.

#### Install dependecies

Once you've got `node`, run the command `npm install` in this project folder
and it will install all of the project-specific dependencies (if you're curious open up `package.json` to see where these are listed).

npm is the _node package manager_.

## Other notes

### 3rd party libraries

Using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
